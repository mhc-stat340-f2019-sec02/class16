    "\n",
    "Statistical models for classifying data into two groups predict the probability a data point belongs to one group or the other.\n",
    "The binary nature of our data suggests we use different methods for evaluating a classification model than a model that predicts a continuous target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "We aim to understand metrics for evaluating classification models. \n",
    "We will learn how to compute and interpret: Accuracy, True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, False Negative, Positive Predictive value, Negative Predictive value, and Brier Score."

    "\n",
    "Our logistic regression model, given a set of $x$ covariates, returns the log-odds a data point belongs to the group we labeled \"1\" versus the group we labeled \"0\".\n",
    "The logistic regression model returns a continuous value, but we need to **decide** whether our data point should be classified as a 0 or 1.\n",
    "The most common method for classifying data points is to classify points that have a positive log-odds as a \"1\" and negative log-odds as \"0\".\n",

    "\n",
    "For a binary classification problem, a decision rule assigns data points to one group or the other.\n",
    "We typically create the following decision rule when using logistic regression, the data point is predicted to belong to group $1$ if the log-odds is greater than or equal to $0$ and predicted to belong to group $0$ is the log-odds is negative.\n",
